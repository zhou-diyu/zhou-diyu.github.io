I am a postdoctoral scholar in School of Computer and Communication Sciences (IC) at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)) hosted by Prof. [Sanidhya Kashyap](https://sanidhya.github.io/). 

Prior to EPFL, I obtained my Ph.D. in computer science in December 2020 from University of California, Los Angeles ([UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/)) advised by Prof. [Yuval Tamir](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~tamir/). Before coming to UCLA, I received my B.S. in computer science from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in 2013.
