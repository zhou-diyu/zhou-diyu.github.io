I am an assistant professor in [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/English/Home.htm) 
at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). 

I was a postdoctoral scholar in School of Computer and Communication Sciences (IC) at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)) hosted by Prof. [George Candea](https://dslab.epfl.ch/people/candea/). Before that, I worked with Prof. [Sanidhya Kashyap](https://sanidhya.github.io/). 

Prior to EPFL, I obtained my Ph.D. in computer science in December 2020 from University of California, Los Angeles ([UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/)) advised by Prof. [Yuval Tamir](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~tamir/). Before coming to UCLA, I received my B.S. in computer science from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in 2013.

Research
======
My research is in the general area of computer systems. I am specifically 
interested in operating systems, storage systems, formal verification, 
dependable computing, concurrency, software/hardware co-design, and recently 
systems for machine learning.
