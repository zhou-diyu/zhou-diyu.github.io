I am a postdoctoral scholar in School of Computer and Communication Sciences (IC) at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)) hosted by Prof. [Sanidhya Kashyap](https://sanidhya.github.io/). 

Prior to EPFL, I obtained my Ph.D. in computer science in December 2020 from University of California, Los Angeles ([UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/)) advised by Prof. [Yuval Tamir](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~tamir/). Before coming to UCLA, I received my B.S. in computer science from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in 2013.

Research
======
My research is in the general area of computer systems. I'm specifically interested in operating systems, concurrency, storage systems, virtualization, and dependable computing. 

My Ph.D. thesis is focused on building **practical, low-overhead** dependability mechanisms (fault-tolerance mechanisms and a debugging tool) for hypervisors, containers, and server applications. The approach involves identifying sweet spots in the design space of dependability mechanisms that balance soundness and overhead, leveraging hardware/operating system/hypervisor support.
