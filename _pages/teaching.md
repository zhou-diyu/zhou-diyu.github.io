I am enthusiastic about teaching and have extensive experience as a TA. Every quarter I teach, I have spent a significant amount of time on preparing/enhancing the teaching material and reflecting on how to improve my teaching from the previous quarters. 

My teaching philosophy is based on two key ideas: "learn by doing" and "the best way to learn is to teach" (i.e., The Feynman Technique). You can find my teaching statement [here](/files/teaching-statement.pdf).

I have TAed the following courses:
1. CS 111: Operating Systems Principles
1. CS 151B: Computer Systems Architecture
1. [CS 35L](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter20/cs35L/): Software Construction Laboratory, a lab course that covers how to use popular Linux software (e.g., gcc, emacs)

You can find **all** of my teaching evaluation below. It shows how I have evolved to be an excellent TA over years!
